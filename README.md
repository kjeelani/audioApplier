Functionality: AudioApplier is a simple command line script that allows you to add audio to a video

An example command line call:

python3 audioApplier.py -v "video.mp4" -a "audio.mp3" -o .5 -g 1.1

Where -v and -a are the video and audio to be superimposed, -o is the beginning offset in seconds, and -g is the gain factor
